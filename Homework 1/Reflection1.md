This assignment was beneficial to learning python but it was exceptionally useful in learning Git and Github. I was forced to expand my comfort zones to learn commands in the terminal, how to navigate Git, and how to navigate Anaconda. Although I was unable to complete pair programming, I can see the value of it. This is becuase I was able to get help from Professor Brough and learn how to better navigate my computer. Without a second pair of eyes, I would not have been able to navigate this assignment.
