## Problems


### __10.1__ 

Let $S = \$100$, $K = \$105$, $r = 8\%$, $T = 0.5$, and $\delta = 0$ (i.e. no dividends). Let $u = 1.3$ and $d = 0.8$, and $n=1$.

- __a.__ What are the premium, $\Delta$, and $B$ for a European call?

- __b.__ What are the premium, $\Delta$, and $B$ for a European put?

### __10.2__

Let $S = \$100$, $K = \$95$, $r = 8\%$, $T = 0.5$, and $\delta = 0$ (i.e. no dividends). Let $u = 1.3$, $d = 0.8$, and $n = 1$.

- __a.__ Verify that the price of a European call is $\$16.196$.

- __b.__ Suppose you observe a call price of $\$17$. What is the arbitrage?

- __c.__ Suppose you observe a call price of $\$15.50$. What is the arbitrage?
